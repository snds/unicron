`RiskTierBadge` (spec: `docs/specs/security/risk-tier-badge.md`): a closed `tier` union (`standard` · `official` · `tolerated`) shown as plain words from the component-owned `riskTierCopy` map (**Built in** · **Verified** · **Use with care**), with one icon and one colour each. `verified` omitted reads "Checking"; `verified={false}` or an unknown tier renders `unverified`; `explain` adds a help control that lists the manifest's `disclosures`. Tokens: `--c-risk-tier-*` (inks and tints per tier, heights). Also exported as `@unicron/ui/risk-tier-badge`.
