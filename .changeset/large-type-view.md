`LargeTypeView` (spec `docs/specs/security/large-type-view.md`): a fullscreen sheet that shows a secret in groups of three (or four), digits in `info`, letters in `foreground`, symbols in `warning`, with captions naming every symbol and every ambiguous glyph, fit-to-width sizing with − / + steps, a 120 s lifetime, hide on window blur, "Spell out" through a polite live region, keep-awake and brightness host hooks, and a `print` variant that is the recovery-kit page. Tokens: the `large-type.*` knobs (`--c-large-type-min-size`, `--c-large-type-max-size`, `--c-large-type-*-ink`, `--c-large-type-lifetime`, …). Also importable as `@unicron/ui/security/large-type-view`.
